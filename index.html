          <strong>Early Exploration and Settlement:</strong><br>
          - 16th Century: European explorers, including Spanish navigators, first reached the Oregon coast. However, it wasn't until the late 18th century that more detailed explorations began.<br>
          - 1792: American captain Robert Gray explored the Columbia River, naming it after his ship, the Columbia Rediviva. This claim later became significant for American interests in the region.<br>
          - 1804-1806: The Lewis and Clark Expedition, commissioned by President Thomas Jefferson, explored the area, providing valuable information and strengthening U.S. claims.<br><br>

          <strong>Oregon Trail and Migration:</strong><br>
          - 1840s: The Oregon Trail became a major route for settlers moving westward. Thousands of pioneers traveled the arduous path, seeking fertile land and new opportunities.<br>
          - 1843: The settlers in the Willamette Valley established a provisional government, marking an important step in organizing the region.<br><br>

          <strong>Oregon Territory:</strong><br>
          - 1846: The Oregon Treaty between the U.S. and Britain resolved the boundary dispute, establishing the 49th parallel as the border between British North America (Canada) and the U.S.<br>
          - 1848: The U.S. Congress created the Oregon Territory, encompassing present-day Oregon, Washington, Idaho, and parts of Wyoming and Montana.<br><br>

          <strong>Path to Statehood:</strong><br>
          - 1850: The Donation Land Claim Act encouraged settlement by granting land to pioneers, boosting the population and development of the territory.<br>
          - 1857: Delegates met in Salem to draft a state constitution, which was approved by voters later that year.<br>
          - February 14, 1859: Oregon was admitted to the Union as the 33rd state. The decision was influenced by the balance of free and slave states, as Oregon was admitted as a free state.<br><br>

          <strong>Oregon's Statehood Legacy:</strong><br>
          Oregon's journey to statehood reflects the broader themes of American expansion and the complex interactions between indigenous populations, European explorers, and American settlers. The stateâ€™s rich history is preserved in its diverse landscapes, cultural heritage, and continuing traditions.
